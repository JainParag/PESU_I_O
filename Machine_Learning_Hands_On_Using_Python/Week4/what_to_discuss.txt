1. knn => 
a) how we can use images directly without extracting the features from it
b) loading the ENTIRE dataset to memory => RAM issues
c) 2 hyperparameters used in KNN => 1. Low value of k and high value of k. Oversmoothing? 2. Actual distance metric used: Euclidean distance? Manhattan distance?
d) Drawbacks :
	i) how no actual learning takes place in knn? If it makes mistake, it has no way to "correct" or "improve" itself for later classification.
	ii) High dimensional data? knn becomes questionable, training time increases with O(n)
e) how since NO PARAMETERS are learnt, classification TIME is more. Increases with the training data size => O(n)
f) Given these cons why study knn? Algorithm is simple. It is easy to understand. And most importantly, it gives us a baseline that we can use to compare neural networks and CNN.
g) Introduction to PARAMETERISED LEARNING => Linear Classifier
